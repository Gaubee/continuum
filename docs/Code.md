## Code

A Code object contains the compiled bytecode of a Script. It also contains most of the static semantics derived from the source such as bound names, declarations, imports/exports, etc. In the short term future it is planned for Code objects to be serializable to a portable form such that code can be compiled once and then redistributed and executed in this form.
